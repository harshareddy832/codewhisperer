- **3-month onboarding** reduced to **3 days**
- **Legacy code maintenance** becomes trivial
- **Code reviews** become architectural discussions

### Closing (30 seconds)
**"This isn't just a developer tool - it's the future of how we understand and work with code."**

1. **Technology Stack Highlight**:
   - IBM watsonx.ai Granite 3.3 for intelligence
   - Tree-sitter for blazing-fast parsing
   - Claude-inspired design for developer experience

2. **Call to Action**:
   - "Imagine this integrated into your IDE"
   - "Picture this analyzing your legacy systems"
   - "This is just the beginning"

## üé¨ Demo Flow Scripts

### Script A: React Analysis Demo
```
"Let's analyze a real React application. Watch as our AI instantly understands the entire codebase architecture."

[Click Analyze React Repository]

"In just 2 seconds, we've analyzed 47 files and 8,420 lines of code. Look at this comprehensive breakdown:
- Architecture style automatically identified as Component-Based
- Design patterns detected: Hooks, Context API, Higher-Order Components
- Interactive dependency graph showing component relationships

This visualization alone would take a developer hours to create manually."
```

### Script B: AI Q&A Demo
```
"Now let's ask our AI about the codebase. This is like having a conversation with a senior developer who's worked on this project for years."

[Click Ask Sample Question]

"The AI understands not just what the code does, but how it fits into the overall architecture. Notice:
- Detailed explanation of state management patterns
- Actual code examples with proper context
- 92% confidence score showing reliability

This is powered by IBM's Granite 3.3 model with 128k context window."
```
